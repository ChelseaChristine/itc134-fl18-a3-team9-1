Once upon a time, in a far off land, there was a very lazy girl who craved adventure. 
In her world magic was freely used, but not without a cost.

In this far away land, perfection was ONLY expected and tolerated from the royal family,
who happened to be quite a humble and modest royal family. An honorable family.
