Once upon a time, in a far off land, there was a very lazy girl who craved adventure. 
In her world magic was freely used, but not without a cost.

In this far away land, perfection was ONLY expected and tolerated from the royal family,
who happened to be quite a humble and modest royal family. An honorable family.

One day the lazy girl, who's name was Rose, decided she should finally get out of the house and do something with her life.
Luck would have it that the same day she had those thoughts, a letter came in the mail for her.
She had been invited to the Princess's 21st birthday.
